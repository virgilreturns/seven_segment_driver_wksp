  The 74HC595 shift register will be driving up to 7 LEDs. It has a max total output of 70 mA and 35 mA for a single pin.
  With 7 LEDs, the maximum individual output pin current is 6.25 mA which can be achieved with 560 ohm resistor in series with
  the diode.

  TESTING REQ: See how much current provides a satisfactory brightness. Consider a transistor based circuit to drive more
  power for the LEDs, 

  Continue to test shift register with 3mm LEDs for now. Need to fix circuit and use 10k+ pull-up/pulldown resistors for
  SRCLOCK, RCLOCK, and SER. SRCLEAR tied to Vcc and OE tied to GND.  

  TEST REVIEW:  Extreme debounce on all pushbuttons and dip switches :(((
                Overall, shift register seems to work fine.
  
  UPCOMING TASKS:
  - Circuit design for microcontroller to shift register, start firmware for transmitting bits, 
  - Test shift register with 7 segment display, continue using 680 ohm resistors
  - (OPTIONAL) create separate 7 segment display on proto board with resistors and header pins
  - Test SPI communication with shift register and 3mm LEDs
  - Implement SPI communication with shift register and 7 segment display

  - Successfully tested shift register with 7 segment display. It works as expected.
  - Need to implement SPI communication with the shift register and the 7 segment display.
 
  - further ideas for UI implementation:

 /* ------------------one button config----------------------
	One button is used to cycle through all of the seven_segment characters
	Straight forward and pin resourceful.
*/

 /* ------------------two button config / rotary encoder ----------------------
	Two buttons are used to cycle through all of the seven_segment characters
	Button 1: cycles forward
	Button 2: cycles backwards
	More intuitive than one button, but uses more pins.
*/
 /* ------------------switch encoding config----------------------
	4 dip switches are used to select a specific character to display on the seven_segment.
	Faster to select a specific character, but requires more pins, and a documentation of the encoding.
	Up to number 9 will be in binary, and the other characters can be attained via documentation.
*/

  Keep 8 diode testing setup for testing with SPI functions
  Finished basic seven segment byte transmission code.

  Interested in implementing code for the UI configs

 Started soldering circuit unto protoboard, probably a bad idea because
 I just had another fantastic idea for an implementation of the project.

 2 button config, one button to cycle through characters, and the other to cycle through the digits.
 This creates a sort of text editor for the seven segment display.

 Other caveats, will need multiplexing with multiple digits, (selecting which VCC to turn on)
 While I only really want no more than 4 digits, I can use a timer to "play" the digits, and shift
 the data through the display. I.E. with 4 digits, I can display a 20 character string by shifting the characters through an array,
 then displaying the array on the 4 digits.

 I can have a timer between configuration and "play" mode, hence if there is no configuration for a certain amount of time, the display will
 start playing the string.

 The first button press of either configuration button will start the configuration mode, and then they will
 function as normal. The display will default to play mode after a certain amount of time of inactivity.

 Other features: A dip switch -> change how many digits are shifted at a time, FULL DISPLAY or BYTE-WISE shifting.
				 -> how big the string can be

 TESTING: Using Analog Discovery 3 (AD3) to read button bounce signal, familizarize with oscilloscope

 Completed:
	-refactored code to support multiple digit display
	-default data will be "Hello"

	Completed testing SPI communication with logic analyzer. Tested data buffers: (0xFF, 0x33, 0x88, {ASCII_TO_ENUM("HELLo") })
	
	KEY TAKEAWAYS: increase prescaler to decrease the SPI frequency to ~1 Mhz. APB1 peripheral I believe for SPI2. Sysclk / 16 ~ 1Mhz.
	Sample frequency should be at least 4 times greater than the transmission frequency.

	There is a bug where the logic analyzer can accurate detect the first buffer, but will fall out of alignment. Doesn't start reading
	immediately when the CLK goes high...

	Examining HC595 datasheet, provides timing requirements for pulse width, max CLK speeds...

	TODO: CREATE PULSE FUNCTION, ADJUST CLOCK FREQ, TRANSMISSION SEQUENCE
	      TIMING REQUIREMENTS: max CLK speed at 2.0 V = 5 Mhz, 4.5 V = 25 Mhz. Pulse Duration SRCLR 100 ns at 2V,
	      SWITCHING CHARACTERISTICS (input to output): ~250 ns

 3/25/2025
	
	Completed testing SPI communication with shift register + one digit display. 
	Tested data: (ENUM_0, - ENUM_3, ENUM_H, ENUM_n, ENUM_o)

	KEY TAKEAWAYS: ENUM_SEVSEG_CHAR list is not accurately defined, at least for some of the letters.
				 : SPI Could be faster, but I won't be able to read the logic on the analyzer...
				 : Might increase SPI CLk from 1 Mhz to 5 Mhz (max)
	
	TODO: TEST/DEBUG ENTIRE REFRESH CYCLE/INTERRUPT CHAIN, watch LATCH_pin, DS_pin, TIMERs, SPI_pins, using Live Expressions
