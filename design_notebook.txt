  The 74HC595 shift register will be driving up to 7 LEDs. It has a max total output of 70 mA and 35 mA for a single pin.
  With 7 LEDs, the maximum individual output pin current is 6.25 mA which can be achieved with 560 ohm resistor in series with
  the diode.

  TESTING REQ: See how much current provides a satisfactory brightness. Consider a transistor based circuit to drive more
  power for the LEDs, 

  Continue to test shift register with 3mm LEDs for now. Need to fix circuit and use 10k+ pull-up/pulldown resistors for
  SRCLOCK, RCLOCK, and SER. SRCLEAR tied to Vcc and OE tied to GND.  

  TEST REVIEW:  Extreme debounce on all pushbuttons and dip switches :(((
                Overall, shift register seems to work fine.
  
  UPCOMING TASKS:
  - Circuit design for microcontroller to shift register, start firmware for transmitting bits, 
  - Test shift register with 7 segment display, continue using 680 ohm resistors
  - (OPTIONAL) create separate 7 segment display on proto board with resistors and header pins
  - Test SPI communication with shift register and 3mm LEDs
  - Implement SPI communication with shift register and 7 segment display

  - Successfully tested shift register with 7 segment display. It works as expected.
  - Need to implement SPI communication with the shift register and the 7 segment display.
 
  - further ideas for UI implementation:

 /* ------------------one button config----------------------
	One button is used to cycle through all of the seven_segment characters
	Straight forward and pin resourceful.
*/

 /* ------------------two button config / rotary encoder ----------------------
	Two buttons are used to cycle through all of the seven_segment characters
	Button 1: cycles forward
	Button 2: cycles backwards
	More intuitive than one button, but uses more pins.
*/
 /* ------------------switch encoding config----------------------
	4 dip switches are used to select a specific character to display on the seven_segment.
	Faster to select a specific character, but requires more pins, and a documentation of the encoding.
	Up to number 9 will be in binary, and the other characters can be attained via documentation.
*/

  Keep 8 diode testing setup for testing with SPI functions
  Finished basic seven segment byte transmission code.

  Interested in implementing code for the UI configs
