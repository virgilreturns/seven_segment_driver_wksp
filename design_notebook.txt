  The 74HC595 shift register will be driving up to 7 LEDs. It has a max total output of 70 mA and 35 mA for a single pin.
  With 7 LEDs, the maximum individual output pin current is 6.25 mA which can be achieved with 560 ohm resistor in series with
  the diode.

  TESTING REQ: See how much current provides a satisfactory brightness. Consider a transistor based circuit to drive more
  power for the LEDs, 

  Continue to test shift register with 3mm LEDs for now. Need to fix circuit and use 10k+ pull-up/pulldown resistors for
  SRCLOCK, RCLOCK, and SER. SRCLEAR tied to Vcc and OE tied to GND.  

  TEST REVIEW:  Extreme debounce on all pushbuttons and dip switches :(((
                Overall, shift register seems to work fine.
  
  UPCOMING TASKS:
  - Test shift register with 7 segment display, continue using 680 ohm resistors
  - (OPTIONAL) create separate 7 segment display on proto board with resistors and header pins
  - Test SPI communication with shift register and 3mm LEDs
  - Implement SPI communication with shift register and 7 segment display
